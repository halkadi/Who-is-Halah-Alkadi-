Hey everyone👋,

In this repository, I will talk about my qualification history 🎓, work and research experience 🔬, and why am I in GitHub 😎. 

In Brief, I have a BS degree in Medical Technology (2003) 👩‍🔬, MS in Bio/CLS (2012) 👩‍🔬, Ph.D. in Bio/CLS (2018) 👩‍🔬, and finally 🤓, MS in Biot/Bioinfo (2021) 👩‍💻. 

I worked as a teacher assistant in Hematology for <2 years 👩‍🏫, pre-doc research fellow for 4 years 🕵️‍♀️, and post-doc research fellow for 2 years.🕵️‍♀️

I have experience in Hematology lab for a total of 2&1/2 years 💉, and research experience in molecular/hematology/ips/gene_editing for a total of 6 years 💪.  

So why am I here in GitHub? if you are new to coding, you will notice that most (if not all) of the coding in GitHub is advanced, and very little explanation of the commands used. That's why I want to add my coding in GitHub, as a beginner I know how it is difficult to learn to code if the little things are left unexplained. Hopefully, I can help others who are starting fresh, more specifically in bioinformatics.
